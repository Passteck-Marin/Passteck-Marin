# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm Marin

**AI Explorer** | **Creative Developer** | **Linux Enthusiast**

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a student in the **DWWM (DÃ©veloppeur Web et Web Mobile)** program, building a solid foundation in modern web technologies.

Beyond my curriculum, I'm deeply passionate about the world of Artificial Intelligence. I dedicate my personal time to exploring the intersection of conversational AI, 3D graphics, and interactive experiences.

## ðŸš€ My Flagship Project: A 3D AI Companion

I am currently developing a personal project that brings an AI assistant to life in a 3D, interactive space. This endeavor is a creative sandbox for me to experiment with cutting-edge AI technologies, completely separate from my web development coursework.

The goal is to create a more personal and engaging alternative to traditional chatbots, running locally with the flexibility to connect to powerful cloud-based models.

### Project Tech Stack:

| Component | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine & 3D** | ![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-478CB0?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine&logoColor=white) | Powers the real-time 3D rendering and application logic. |
| **Local Intelligence**| ![Ollama](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ollama-7C5BE0?logo=ollama&logoColor=white) | Runs local Large Language Models for offline and private AI interaction. |
| **Cloud Connectivity** | `API Integration` | Connects to external providers like Google (Gemini), OpenAI (ChatGPT), and OpenRouter. |
| **Voice Synthesis**| `GPT-SoVITS` | Generates natural, expressive speech for the AI's voice. |
| **Voice Recognition**| `Faster-Whisper` | Transcribes spoken user input with high speed and accuracy. |
| **Avatar** | `Vroid Studio` / `FBX`| Custom 3D character models designed in Vroid and implemented in Godot. |

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

> *"Learn the rules of the web by day, and break the rules of reality with AI by night."*

I believe in the power of open-source software and the Linux philosophy of customization and control. My approach is to learn by building, whether it's a clean web application or a complex AI experiment.
